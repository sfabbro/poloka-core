\section intro_database What does the so-called data base in poloka?

The purpose of having some database code is to decouple most of the processing
code from the actual way data is stored. The data can then be accessed through
routines which transform abstract names into genuine file names. Implementing this
way provides the tremendeous advantage that many actual database organizations
can be accomodated through the same software interface. Most (if not all) code
does not require any modification in case the actual data base used changes.

\section implem_database Implementation of the DbImage

A DbImage is basically an image and all its associated catalogues,
weight maps and other files. It is currently implemented very simply
as a directory and its names. The DbImage "name" will be the directory
name. Typically a DbImage directory contains:

- <dirname>/.dbstuff : mandatory 0 byte file to indicate it is a DbImage
- <dirname>/calibrated.fits : the flatfielded image
- <dirname>/flat.fits : flat image used to flatfield the image
- <dirname>/dead.fits : dead pixels image (each dead pixel has value 1)

If you need poloka to flatfield your data, you will need other types,
such as raw, bias, fringe. The strict minimum to start post-processing
your data is calibrated and the .dbstuff files. Note poloka uses
cfitsio for FITS I/O, so compressed FITS files (.gz, .fz) are also understood.

Poloka utilities will access each DbImage with the -<type>
option. Example:

\code
header -cal <dbimage>
dbls -raw <dbimage>
\endcode


\section dbconfig The data base configuration file

The actual location where data is to be searched for is
given through a configuration file. This configuration file is searched
 -# if the environment variable POLOKA_DB_CONFIG is defined, as the file name it provides,
 -# as .dbconfig in the current directory
 -# as $HOME/.dbconfig

\section dbconfig_example Example of a DbConfig configuration file

A Db config file consists in mnemonic tags followed by actual file paths.
Those file paths can use * [] but not {}.
Here is an example of a Db config file:

\code
#this is a comment
ImagePath
{
here : .
cfht99 : /snovad15/cfht99/1999*
vlt99 : /snovad1/vlt99/1999*
newstuff : /snovad8/wiyn99
}

# where to find astrometric catalogs (non-USNO catalogs usually)
CatalogPath
{
  /data/my_catalogs
  /data/my_od/catalogs
  /data/catalogs/D*
}

#what are the image names for the various DbImage derived classes
# .fits : regular fits image
# .fz : rice compressed fits image
# .fits.gz gzip compression
ImageNames
{
  ImageSum {satur.fz}
  TransformedImage {calibrated.fits satur.fits.gz}
}

\endcode
