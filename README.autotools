Instructions for Poloka developers using autotools
==================================================

* All the Makefile.am/configure.ac/m4 macros have been refactored
  following standard GNU rules for those files, sometimes taking
  macros from the autoconf-archive on savannah.gnu.org

* SExtractor library (now in http://gitorious.org/poloka/libsex),
  cfitsio (repacked version:
  http://gitorious.org/poloka/cfitsio/blobs/raw/master/cfitsio-repack.bash),
  snfit (2.2.1 and above) and ImageMagick install a pkgconfig file to track their
  dependencies. Do a man pkg-config if you don't know anything about
  it.

* To build the autotools from scratch (Makefile, configure), use

     $ autoreconf -fv

* Do not force the optimization flags in the Makefile.am/configure.ac
  (CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FFLAGS, LDFLAGS) unless you really know what your
  are doing. These flags are reserved for the user (who could use
  specific architecture flags). If you notice some bugs using
  optimization flags (the default is -g -O2), fix the code instead of
  forcing lower optimization, unless this is a gcc bug (gcc < 4.4 has
  a few corner cases, but I doubt you will encounter them).

  If you want to pass your flags (either optimization or debug), use
  the environment variables during configure time. Below an example to
  pass safe C++ optimization flags, standard C debug flags, and
  linking flags using as-needed feature of ld (obviously use consistent
  for all {C,F,FC,CXX}FLAGS, not like this example):
      
      $ ./configure CXXFLAGS="-O2 -march=native" CFLAGS="-Wall -g" LDFLAGS="-Wl,--as-needed"

  This way "make" will pick up those flags on every call. You
  can overwrite the flags on the make command:

      $ make CPPFLAGS="-DDEBUG" CXXFLAGS="-O0 -ggdb"

* One way to build your stuff in multiple architectures:

      $ tar xf poloka-0.3.0.tar.gz
      $ mkdir poloka-build-x86
      $ cd poloka-build-x86
      $ ../poloka-0.3.0/configure --libdir=$HOME/lib32 --bindir=$HOME/bin32
      $ make -j <ncpu+1> && make -j <ncpu+1> install

* Rolling a poloka release

  0) choose a release number <x.y.z> in configure.ac
  1) tag the commit (cvs tag or git tag)
  2) autoreconf && ./configure && make dist
  3) scp poloka-<x.y.z>.tar.gz <poloka-web-site>:
  4) email friends

* Cleaning up. To remove all automatically generated files:

     $ make maintainer-clean
