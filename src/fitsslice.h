    \brief  Load successively slices of fits images in memory.

    When one needs image data for a single traversal, FitsSlices
    and FitsParallelSlices should be considered. At the moment
    both classes only provide input services. See \ref example_slices
    for an example.

only a slice of the image will reside in memory at a time.
To be used when many images have to be accessed at the same time,
in parallel (see FitsParallelSlices), or maybe to traverse a very big image. */
