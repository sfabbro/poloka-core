poloka - aka TOADS
==================

Poloka is a software package to process astronomical images. It can do
several processing steps such as flat-fielding, detection/object
cataloguing, aperture and PSF photometry, geometric
transformation/resampling and image stacking. But what it does best is
image subtraction (PSF match) and light curve reconstruction for
transient objects such as supernova.

To install poloka, see the INSTALL file. 

To develop with poloka, read the code :( and see README.dev. 
For all other documentation, we have yet to write something decent. To
contact authors, see AUTHORS.
