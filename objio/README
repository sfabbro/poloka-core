objio is an attempt to design a lightweight C++ object persistency
system. The persistency code is automatically generated (currently
using swig -- http://www.swig.org). The system should be able to
support automatic schema evolution. The primary output format is
currently XML, although additional file format should be added in the
future.

In what follows we present a brief overview of the the objio internal
structure. Section (I) will present the objio classes, section (II)
will present how to use the current version of objio. Section (III)
will present the current limitations of the system and our plans to
overcome them.

(I) The objio classes:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 1) Persisters:
 --------------
 see persister.h 
 
 A persister<T> derives from handle<T> A handle<T> is a
 smart pointer to an object of type T, which knows whether
 it owns or not the object it points to. A persister<T>
 is nothing more than a smart pointer to an object of
 type T.
 
 If T is tagged as "persistant", a persister<T> is a little more than
 a smart pointer: it also knows precisely the internal structure of the
 object it points to. real persisters are template specialization of 
 the type persister<T>. They are generated automatically for the 
 C++ header files using the program dictgen.


 2) obj_input and obj_output:
 ----------------------------
 see objio.h

 obj_output and obj_input present a uniform interface to the
 persisters. These classes' methods allow to read and write
 atomic types (float,double,char etc...), persisters, and 
 STL containers.
 
 obj_input and obj_output do not read and write the object themselves.
 They just redirect the calls to a streamer object, which does
 actually the work. The default streamer is called xmlstream and knows how
 to write atomic types and STL containers in XML. But it can be replaced by
 an other streamer.
 
 We chose to define obj_input and obj_output as template classes of the 
 streamer type:
   template<class IOS> class obj_input;
 we think it 
 
 
 3) xmlstream and other backends:
 --------------------------------
 see xmlstream.h
 
 

 4) The dictgen program:
 -----------------------
 see dictgen.*
     cpptype.*
     cppclassmember.*
     cppclass.*
     cppswigclassreader.*
     codegen.cc

 and $ dictgen --help
 
 The dictgen program reads a header file and generate persisters for all
 the classes defined in this header file and marked as "persistent".
 dictgen generates several output files:
    - <header_file_name>_dict.h   which contains mostly #include statements
    - <header_file_name>_dict.cc  which contains static definitions and code 
                                  to register the persisters.
    - <class_name>__persister.h   which contains the definition of the persister
                                  generated for the class of name <class_name>.


(II) How to use objio
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
To obtain a persitent class, you only have to do this
in your file myclass.h :

#include <persistence.h>
 
class MyClass {
 
  CLASS_VERSION(MyClass,1); // <-- add this in the private
                             // <-- section of the class
  #define MyClass__is_persistent // <-- this as well
 
public:
  MyClass();
  ~MyClass();
 
  //.......
};

AND add in Makefile.am to libtoads_la_SOURCES : myclasse_dict.cc. 

To use your class in a main, you have to include :
#include "myclass_dict.h"
#include "objio.h"
#include "typemgr.h"

You can then write your class, or a CountedRef<MyClass>
if your class derives from RefCount. But you can't write a pointer
to your class.


(III) Where we stand now: current limitations and the road ahead
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

objio currently suffers from a few limitations. Most of them
are related to swig:
 
  - templates classes are not correctly parsed. We have to 
    help dictgen using the // define_template_args directive
  - the dependencies are not correcty handled. For example 
    if a persistent class Foo has a member of type Bar
    (or inherits from Bar), and if Bar was not defined in 
    the same file, we cannot automatically make sure that 
    persisters where generated for class Bar.
  - the XML generated by swig is difficult to parse, and we
    have no guarantee that it won't evolve in the future.
  - the XML generated by swig is sometimes invalid ("<" in 
    element attributes, for example), and we are lucky that 
    libxml2 is rather tolerant.
  - most of the objio directives could be added as commentaries.
    swig does not know how to parse commentaries.


Therefore, we should think about writing our own parser. It should
stay rather simple (even simple than the parser used by doxygen).  The
only thing it should be able to do is to parse commentary directives
and class/class-member/typedef/enums declarations. The input of this
parser would just be the output of the C++ preprocessor (which would
have done all the includes). And we would be able to deal nicely with:
the templates and the dependencies. We would be able to easily issue
directives to dictgen. It would even be possible to analyse the code and
generate persisters for all the needed template instantiations.

To make a class persistent, we would write do something like:

//$$                                  << start dictgen block
// PersistentClass: Foo               << class Foo is persistent
// Version: 5                         << current version
// Transient: i j k                   << do not write out these members
// Instantiate: Foo<int> Foo<double>  << persisters for these instantiations
//$$
template<class T>
class Foo {
  PERSISTENT_CLASS;                   << "template class<T> class persister;"
public:
  Foo();
  ~Foo();
 
  T&  bar() { return t_; }

private:
  T t_;
  int i,j,k;
};
